# SeqBenchmarks

Inside scripts need to be modified to run on a different environment.

1. ```bpl``` contains benchmarks from Shaz, which should be run by boogie.
2. ```diem``` contains benchmarks from diem. 
   ```diem/functional``` contains benchmarks from diem repo in ```/diem/language/move-prover/tests/sources/functional```.
   ```diem/modules``` contains benchmarks from diem repo in ```diem/language/diem-framework/modules```.
   Each benchmark corresponding to a folder, which contains different log files generated by the scripts ```gen_*.sh```. ```*.t``` corresponding to running time.
   ```diem/modules_summary.py``` is a script to generate csv from log files for modules benchmarks.
   ```diem/functional_summary.py``` is a script to generate csv from log files for functional benchmarks.
3. ```SMT_LIB``` contains benchmarks from SMT_LIB, currently have sequence benchmarks translated from array benchmarks QF_AX.
4. ```cvc_regression``` contains handcrafted smt benchmarks, or some small benchmarks collected during debugging.
